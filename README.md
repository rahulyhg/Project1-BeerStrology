# Project1- Beer-Strology

Our first team App building project. 
Team Members: Libby Duggan, Laura Gillespie, Todd Williams & Ron Wazny

We decided to make our App a "Fun - app" not one that is neccassarily helpful but like most apps out there provide you with some fun and flavor to your life.  The whole premise was "Consult the Stars and get your Beer"

Our App "Beer-Strology" combines giving you your daily horoscope and then suggests a 3 IPA Beers based on
your Horoscope and 1 extra as a "Wildcard" option.
 The App doesn't solve any problems, as earlier stated it was/is an App  just for fun. 
 
 The App allows you to set up and account, get your horoscope along with a few provided beer selections.
 Also create a profile page showing your profile picture and favorite bottle(s) of "Beer"
  The App also stored your date via "Firebase"
 
 The Front End of the project was handled by Ron, Todd & Laura - HTML & css
 The Back End was handled by Libby & Laura. - Firebase & Javascript
 There was some overlapping of tasks as we neared the due date. 
 
 Improvements:
 1: Time permitting we would like to add a chat function within the App fro people that have an account.
 2: Include a Five Star Rating System (to rate the selections/recomandations you try)
 3: Link up to local Bottle Shops and Breweries that would carry the selections offed by the App.
 4: Try to make it more Social. (Not neccasarily FaceBook but social)
 
 
 Challanges:
 There was Challenges using the API Key for the Horoscope site. It only allows your API key to be active for 
 Two weeks, then you need to sign up again.
 
 There was a challenge trying to get Foundation to play nice with our .css. (Since it was the first time any of us used anything other than Bootstrap).
